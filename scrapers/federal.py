"""
Federal C&I incentives that apply in every state (so they show up for Utah too).

These are the high-value, relatively stable federal programs a commercial or
industrial facility can stack on top of utility rebates -- most importantly the
Investment Tax Credit, which for a battery purchase is usually the largest single
incentive (30% of installed cost). DSIRE would normally be the automated source
for these, but its API now returns 403 and its pages render program data via
client-side JS, so it cannot be scraped reliably. These are curated from the
authoritative federal sources linked per program; the daily scanner still runs
and auto-expires anything past its date. Tax law changes -- verify current terms.
