"""
Rocky Mountain Power (PacifiCorp) -- Utah wattsmart(R) Business incentives.
Commercial & Industrial energy efficiency only (UCREW scope).

Accuracy note: rather than one broad "custom" bucket, measures are broken out to
the granularity RMP actually publishes, with the exact rate for each. RMP posts
its Utah incentive amounts in per-category pages/PDFs (linked per measure below);
the daily scanner keeps the pages live-checked and auto-expires stale ones. When
RMP revises a rate, update the matching entry here.
